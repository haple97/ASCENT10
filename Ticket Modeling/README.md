This is an on-going task that aims to identify passengers behavior in air travel. In particular, value of time and value of comfort are assessed for effect on passenger decision to fly on a certain route. 

Initially, BTS DB1B data (https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DatabaseInfo.asp?DB_ID=125) are used for this task. However, the data were proved to be insufficient for the task, as they lack direct metrics of time and are limited to only routes operated by US-domestic carriers. 

Further data collection and analysis are taking place.
